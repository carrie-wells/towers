# Towers of Hanoi
This traditional challenge moves 5 discs across 3 towers according to a specific set of rules.
## How to Run:
Download all of the files onto your computer. Drag the index.html file into your browser. Click "Make Move" and watch the discs move between the towers until you complete the puzzle. A completion notification will pop-up when you have finished.

## Future Improvements:
Make different color discs; allow the user to select the number of discs (e.g. 3, 4, 5); add an automated feature where the puzzle is completed with a single click
